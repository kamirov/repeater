# Repeater

Tool to help you remember dance patterns. Specify a dance style, add moves and combos to the list, and this app will randomly read out items from the list based on periods you set. Initial moves on the list (marked in gold) are prioritized and are read out more often to help you better learn them. As you learn moves, check them off to mark them as 'learned', and they'll go into a separate pile.
